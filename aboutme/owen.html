      <p>My name is Owen Correll and I am a sophomore studying Integrated Design & Media here at NYU. I am from Los Angeles, California,
        and I have always been surrounded and fascinated by computers and videogames. I came here to NYU in order to hopefully expand my knowledge
        and interests within the fields.</p>
        <p>On the side, I love film, photography, drawing, and writing. I have a minor in Art History and I love spending time in museums whenever I'm free. I hope
          to eventually incorporate my love for the arts into my career, whatever that may look like.
